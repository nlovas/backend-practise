Cosplay is a hobby for many people who express their love\r\n          for a character, video game, comic, movie, anime, book, or tv series.\r\n          Cosplays can be any combination of hand-made or purchased from a\r\n          store.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <h3>Why would someone want to do that?</h3>\r\n        <div>\r\n          There are many reasons, but to put it simply, for the fun of it!
