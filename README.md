# backend-practise

This is a website created to practise backend technology.
I have created and am following my design document that includes the user stories and requirements. It will be linked here eventually.

This website acts as a social media for cosplayers! Users can show off their cosplays as well as share tips and tricks of their craft.

The front end is created using [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
I am using Visual Studio Code as my editor.
The backend is using Postgres and Express (Node) and pg-promise to connect the two. (config is gitignore'd for privacy reasons)

Resources I found useful:
