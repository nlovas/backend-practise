# backend-practise

This is a website created to practise backend technology.
I have created and am following my design document that includes the user stories and requirements. It will be linked here eventually.

This website acts as a social media for cosplayers! Users can show off their cosplays as well as share tips and tricks of their craft.

### Resources and tutorials I found useful:

- [Setting up a RESTful API with Node.js and PostgreSQL](https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-postgresql-d96d6fc892d8/)
- [Setting up PostgreSQL on Windows](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_12_0/MediaServer/Guides/html/English/Content/Getting_Started/Configure/_TRN_Set_up_PostgreSQL.htm)

### Misc Notes:

- In Windows, local Postgresql can be started/stopped under "Services" in the task manager.
- Postgres config has been gitignore'd for privacy reasons
