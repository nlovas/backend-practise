# backend-practise

This is a website created to practise backend technology.
I have created and am following my design document that includes the user stories and requirements. It will be linked here eventually.

This website acts as a social media for cosplayers! Users can show off their cosplays as well as share tips and tricks of their craft.

- Postgres config has been gitignore'd for privacy reasons
