A site where cosplayers can share photos\r\n          of their cosplays, make cosplans, befriend other cosplayers, and more!\r\n        </div>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>FAQ</h2>\r\n        <h3>Cosplay? What's that?</h3>\r\n        <div>\r\n          Cosplay is a blend of the words \"Costume\" and \"Play\" and is an\r\n          activity where someone wears a costume to represent a specific\r\n          character. Cosplay is a hobby for many people who express their love\r\n          for a character, video game, comic, movie, anime, book, or tv series.\r\n          Cosplays can be any combination of hand-made or purchased from a\r\n          store.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <h3>Why would someone want to do that?</h3>\r\n        <div>\r\n          There are many reasons, but to put it simply, for the fun of it! Some\r\n          people love the challenge of recreating a complex character design,\r\n          some do it to compete in cosplay competitions, some to meet people\r\n          with shared interests, some perform, some just want to make people\r\n          smile.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <h3>So what is this website for?</h3>\r\n        <div>\r\n          This website is for cosplayers to show off their work, make friends,\r\n          and share crafting secrets. BUT officially this website is being used\r\n          as a way for me to learn back-end development.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <h3>Wait... Who made this website?</h3>\r\n        <div>\r\n          {\" \"}\r\n          <Link href=\"//github.com/nlovas\">\r\n            <a>Me!</a>\r\n          </Link>{\" \"}\r\n        </div>\r\n        <h3>What are some upcoming features?</h3>\r\n        <div>\r\n          I'd love to call some API's in order to have a database of characters\r\n          and series on hand. I'd also like to be able to tag certain parts of a\r\n          costume for a character.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAoCA;AAAA;AAYA;;;;AAnDA;AACA;AAqDA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
